            <p>Gaining experience working with a small business  owner to create a site he loved, and giving him something that he just couldent get with squarespace.</p>
            <img src="img/portfolio-details.jpg" alt="">
            <p>I would like to say that before I became interseted in web developement and learned to program, I never needed a website, so I never learned the horrors and PRICE of using a website builder until I met the owner of Isler Custom Gun Works. I met him through a mutual connection in my family and we began to talk about his business and the difficulty he has had trying to get his website to look just the way he wanted using their website builder. Although Mark was a BRILLAINT engineer, he was not a computer guy, and on top of that the website builder he struggled with also cost him a small mortgage payment each month! <br><strong>Luckily, I was able to offer him a solution... </strong> </p>
            <p>I told the owner of the business that I could use his website as a reference, and I could create an exact copy of his website from scratch, and instead of him struggling to make the changes and updates himself, I could make the changes for him at his discretion.   I told him I could host the site as a developer for free so he could completely erase the cost and the hassle of squarespace for a site updated exactly how he wants it. And as of now, 2 months later, I work for him and I am responsible for all website maintenance. Although he decides how the page is going to look, I'm happy i've learned enough to be able to deliver exactly what he wants without stressing out *that* much. Finally, as I gain even more skills I am going to create new versions of his website for him, with bettter functionality, over time. We just launched his website, but I plan to make an update to the image carousels first creating them in React.js to improve the look and functionality of it. I'm grateful I get to have the experience of working with someone to deliver what they want, and I get to work with a really awesome small business while I am at it.</p>
            <p>Although The website content and design is not exactly how I would do it, I'm happy I got to learn a little about providing my programming skills thus far as a service for someone</p>
